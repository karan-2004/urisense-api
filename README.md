# Urisense API

  > The API is live on: https://karanraj1324.pythonanywhere.com/

  - It is a restful API powered by django rest framework and mysql
  - It is fully authenticated and permission based, the test results can only be accessed by the user who got tested
  - Used JWT token authentication
  - used filters and ordering to get the latest test details
  - The backend can be developed without database support by just getting the image and generating json response but I wanted to ensure that it is a fully
functional website and to keep track of the users previous data.
  - user's all the tests get stored along with its results
  - for now the client only displays the last test details
  - It was hosted on pythononanywhere
  - used swagger UI for the API schema
